* create a link from the create game pop up to then transition to the game room
* add a leaderboard to the game room
* only allow players to answer a question once
* need a scoring system in place
* a mechanism to delete the game after they are finished
    * maybe whoever created the game has admin rights to delete it?
    * auto delete doesn't really work if I want to host it for free
* deploy the front end and backend
    * probably use vercel since it is free
* make sure to have some sort of way to limit the reads and writes to my database so that I don't get charged for it
* get the web sockets to work
