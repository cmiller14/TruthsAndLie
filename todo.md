* create a link from the create game pop up to then transition to the game room get them to add a name and make them add a name before joining
* create an admin page for me to delete games and players from games if needed.
* a mechanism to delete the game after they are finished
    * maybe whoever created the game has admin rights to delete it?
    * auto delete doesn't really work if I want to host it for free
